# emacs.d
My set of common Emacs configuration files.

## organization

*init.el* contain basic configuration and logic to bootstrap the rest of the configuration

Personal configuration code is in *preferences*.

Modules not managed by package are kept in the directory *site-lisp*, which is currently empty, so doesn't exist in the git repository.
