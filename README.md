# emacs.d
My set of common Emacs configuration files.

## Goal
To have a sharp axe wherever I happen to set up shop.

## Organization

Use *require-package* to ensure the presence of known set of desired packages.

*init.el* contain basic configuration and logic to bootstrap the rest of the configuration

Per-module and personal configuration code is kept in *elisp*
