# emacs.d
My set of common Emacs configuration files.

## Goal
To have a sharp axe wherever I happen to set up shop.

## Organization

Use `require-package` to ensure the presence of known set of desired packages.

`init.el` contain basic configuration and logic to bootstrap the rest of the configuration.

Per-module and personal configuration code is kept in `elisp`.


Local, installation-specific code lives in `elisp/mdc-local.el`. This file is not required to exist, so only needs to be created if needed.

External dependencies, such as packages loaded through package system, repositories cloned from GitHub, etc., are put in an outside directory, `~/lib/emacs/` to minimize interaction with revision control.
